# Proposal

Bohcura is proposed to be the platform solution where professional chefs and food enthusiasts connect in more meaningful, relationship-centric ways than typical recipe sites and social media platforms provide.

The professional chef can have a full featured profile where they list their professional experience and bona fides, and where they create their own catalogue of culinary creations.

Food enthusiasts can scroll through rosters of chefs and lists of recipes. To get more detail on a chef, an enthusiast can click a chef card to see a chef’s profile page that lists their details and their recipes. Click a recipe summary card anywhere will present the enthusiast with the recipe detail including description, pre time, cook time, ingredients and preparation methods.

Ultimately, a great value add would be features that let foodies filter chefs by geography, and filter recipes by course/dish, and food type.

Chefstalk is a social media app that allows chefs to share images of their creations and promotes user interaction within a post and among users/chefs. There is not much with regards to user features interacting with the chefs’ recipes. 
Hire A Chef provides a way for people to contact chefs and view their experience but does not focus on imagery and recipes.
Yummly has features where chefs can post recipes and users can save recipes, but does not have a good feature for users to interact with other users and chefs.

- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

# Target Audience

Potential Users Feedback:  Chefs using social media or template sites are frustrated with the experience of sharing more complete stories of their culinary creations. They want to be able to create profiles that showcase their work and themselves more professionally.
Validation of solution: While formal validation with thorough user testing hasn’t been completed, user interviews have been conducted.

# Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
