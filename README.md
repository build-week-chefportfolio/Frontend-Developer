# Proposal

Bohcura is proposed to be the platform solution where professional chefs and food enthusiasts connect in more meaningful, relationship-centric ways than typical recipe sites and social media platforms provide.

The professional chef can have a full featured profile where they list their professional experience and bona fides, and where they create their own catalogue of culinary creations.

Food enthusiasts can scroll through rosters of chefs and lists of recipes. To get more detail on a chef, an enthusiast can click a chef card to see a chef’s profile page that lists their details and their recipes. Click a recipe summary card anywhere will present the enthusiast with the recipe detail including description, pre time, cook time, ingredients and preparation methods.

Ultimately, a great value add would be features that let foodies filter chefs by geography, and filter recipes by course/dish, and food type.

- Hire A Chef provides a way for people to contact chefs and view their experience but does not focus on imagery and recipes.
- Yummly has features where chefs can post recipes and users can save recipes, but does not have a good feature for users to interact with other users and chefs.
